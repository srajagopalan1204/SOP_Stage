Use the Shopping List function to perform these actions: Select products from a customerâ€™s ordering history within a month/year range. Select products that are listed in the ordering history and automatically batch load the products into the sales order as separate line items. Select products from a list of specific previous orders or from a specific product list. Use the Shopping List to show a list with these elements: All of the products a customer has ordered in the last two months The last quantity ordered for each product The last price that was given for each product Past sales totals for products by month You can select individual products from the Shopping List to add to the order, or add all products from the Shopping List to the order. You can change the quantity to order for each product.",

      "narr3": "S6. select shopping list type  Promotional Products shopping list Promotional products are products that are on sale at a special price or discount for a limited time. Promotional pricing records are set up in PD Pricing Setup at either the product or product price type level. When you add the product to the customerâ€™s order, the price is obtained from PD Pricing Setup. The promotional price is then charged to the customer. You can view pricing detail in the Pricing view in the Add Line Item section of Sales Order Entry. To view all current promotions, select the Shopping List option and then click Promotional Products. Recalling a large number of records can affect your systemâ€™s performance. To minimize the number of records to sort through, specify the maximum number of records to display. You can also filter the records that are displayed in Customer Order Pad Filter Setup to view only specific customers, customer types, and product categories. When filters are defined, those particular records are not displayed in the Shopping List. When you select to automatically launch this style, each time the Shopping List is accessed, promotional pricing is launched. If you clear the Automatically Launch This Style option, you can select from the different styles available. Past Sales shopping list You can select products from a list of products that the customer has purchased previously by selecting Past Sales. Specify a range of months and the number of product records to recall for the Shopping List. You can also include past sales for these types of products: Nonstocks products Products that were sold from the warehouse on the order to the customer on the order and the customer's ship tos. Products that were sold to the customer or ship to on the order from any warehouse. The recommended quantity for the products in the Shopping List is based on the first order found. To see past sales information as monthly totals, use the Past Sales window. Previous Orders shopping list Customers often order the same product repeatedly, or duplicate entire orders. The Previous Orders function lets you import product from up to 10 past orders into the current Shopping List. These orders can originate from any customer account. Because your pricing might have changed since the original order was shipped, you can have the system re-price the products or retain the original pricing. The recommended quantity is based on the first order found. Product List shopping list Product lists are user-defined lists of product set up in Product List Setup. Sales personnel or inbound call centers use these lists primarily to promote product sales on slow-moving products or overstocked products to their customers. If you use a Product List, select the Product List Type and specify the number of products you want to recall. The product list is then moved into your current Shopping List. The recommended quantity is based on the product list.",

You can tie a stock or nonstock component line to a purchase order or warehouse transfer, including a direct order. If a component of the prebuilt kit is another prebuilt kit, then you can tie the component kit to a work order. Kit component sourcing is initiated on the Kits page in Advanced Line Entry. You can source one or more components from the Multi-Comp Sourcing page. You can also source a component when you add a component to a kit. If you create a fabricated kit in Sales Order Entry, then you must source the components in KP Work Order Center Entry. Ties are only created if the quantity ordered is less than the quantity reserved. To create a tie for a component that has the full quantity reserved, add the kit to the sales order without sourcing the component. Then, in the Kit Details section for the component, change the reserved amount for component to less than the quantity needed before creating the tie. The tie is created for the quantity ordered less the quantity reserved. Note: You cannot delete a component that is tied to a source document from a sales order. Use these instructions to create a tie for one or more components: Create a stock order. In Advanced Line Entry, specify the BOD or nonstock kit in the Product field, and then specify the quantity. Click Kits. Select one or more components to tie to a sourcing document, and then click Multi-Comp Sourcing. Specify the product source. Complete the remaining fields for the selected product source. When you are sourcing a single component, the ARP vendor or warehouse is displayed. When you are sourcing multiple components, the ARP vendor or warehouse is not displayed because the ARP for each component can be different.

      "narr3": "S21. Confirm Pricing  Selling products for highest price paid If a customer places an order for a product and has historically paid a higher price than the price that defaults in Sales Order Entry, you can set system options to force the higher price for that product and customer. This ensures that the customer is not offered the product at a price less than they are accustomed to paying, and you receive the highest margin on the sale. This may also encourage customers to agree to a contract price to receive a better price in the future. To implement the Highest Price Paid pricing search, you must set two options in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders: Months History and Exclude Level 2. These options define the number of months of sales history to search for the highest price, and whether to exclude Price Type Level 2 sales in the search. The Highest Price Paid search is not conducted if the original default price was determined using a contract price. A contract price is a Price Type level 1 (Customer/Product) PD Pricing Setup record. The contract price is not changed by the Highest Price Paid search. Additionally, if you use Price Type level 2 pricing records (Cust/Prod Price Type, Cust/Prod Line, Cust/Prod Cat, or Cust/Rebate Type), and the Exclude Level 2 option is selected, any prices that originally default on the sales order line using level 2 pricing records are not overridden by the highest price paid. If you use promotional pricing, you still have the option to choose between the promotional price and non-promotional price. The non-promotional price reflects the highest price, if it applies. If you do not have permission to select a promotional price (the Access Promo Price in OE option in SA Operator Setup-Entry Options is not selected), the Promo Price Default selection in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders determines the price to use: Lowest, Promo, or Regular. This automatic selection may result in the promo price instead of the highest price being selected. You can override contractual level pricing with multiple level price search. This pricing search can conflict with the Highest Price Paid search. We recommend you select one method or the other, not both. When a sales order line price is replaced with a higher price by this search, the order number, suffix, and line number are stored on the new order line. In addition, the Price Origin Code is set to â€œHâ€. This code is displayed in Sales Order Inquiry and Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry. To prevent the highest price search in Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry, select Return/Ignore Highest Price. Run the Sales Order Master List Report to see the Highest Price Order and Line that affected the Highest Price calculation. This is printed under the Original System Line Data section.",

      "narr3": "S21. Confirm Pricing  Selling products for highest price paid If a customer places an order for a product and has historically paid a higher price than the price that defaults in Sales Order Entry, you can set system options to force the higher price for that product and customer. This ensures that the customer is not offered the product at a price less than they are accustomed to paying, and you receive the highest margin on the sale. This may also encourage customers to agree to a contract price to receive a better price in the future. To implement the Highest Price Paid pricing search, you must set two options in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders: Months History and Exclude Level 2. These options define the number of months of sales history to search for the highest price, and whether to exclude Price Type Level 2 sales in the search. The Highest Price Paid search is not conducted if the original default price was determined using a contract price. A contract price is a Price Type level 1 (Customer/Product) PD Pricing Setup record. The contract price is not changed by the Highest Price Paid search. Additionally, if you use Price Type level 2 pricing records (Cust/Prod Price Type, Cust/Prod Line, Cust/Prod Cat, or Cust/Rebate Type), and the Exclude Level 2 option is selected, any prices that originally default on the sales order line using level 2 pricing records are not overridden by the highest price paid. If you use promotional pricing, you still have the option to choose between the promotional price and non-promotional price. The non-promotional price reflects the highest price, if it applies. If you do not have permission to select a promotional price (the Access Promo Price in OE option in SA Operator Setup-Entry Options is not selected), the Promo Price Default selection in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders determines the price to use: Lowest, Promo, or Regular. This automatic selection may result in the promo price instead of the highest price being selected. You can override contractual level pricing with multiple level price search. This pricing search can conflict with the Highest Price Paid search. We recommend you select one method or the other, not both. When a sales order line price is replaced with a higher price by this search, the order number, suffix, and line number are stored on the new order line. In addition, the Price Origin Code is set to â€œHâ€. This code is displayed in Sales Order Inquiry and Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry. To prevent the highest price search in Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry, select Return/Ignore Highest Price. Run the Sales Order Master List Report to see the Highest Price Order and Line that affected the Highest Price calculation. This is printed under the Original System Line Data section.",
