Promotional pricing records are set up in PD Pricing Setup at either the product or product price type level. When you add the product to the customer's order, the price is obtained from PD Pricing Setup. The promotional price is then charged to the customer. You can view pricing detail in the Pricing view in the Add Line Item section of Sales Order Entry. To view all current promotions, select the Shopping List option and then click Promotional Products. Recalling a large number of records can affect your system's performance. To minimize the number of records to sort through, specify the maximum number of records to display. You can also filter the records that are displayed in Customer Order Pad Filter Setup to view only specific customers, customer types, and product categories. When filters are defined, those particular records are not displayed in the Shopping List. When you select to automatically launch this style, each time the Shopping List is accessed, promotional pricing is launched. If you clear the Automatically Launch This Style option, you can select from the different styles available.

Products that were sold to the customer or ship to on the order from any warehouse. The recommended quantity for the products in the Shopping List is based on the first order found.

The Previous Orders function lets you import product from up to 10 past orders into the current Shopping List. These orders can originate from any customer account. Because your pricing might have changed since the original order was shipped, you can have the system re-price the products or retain the original pricing. The recommended quantity is based on the first order found. Product List shopping list Product lists are user-defined lists of product set up in Product List Setup. Sales personnel or inbound call centers use these lists primarily to promote product sales on slow-moving products or overstocked products to their customers.

You can tie a stock or nonstock component line to a purchase order or warehouse transfer, including a direct order. If a component of the prebuilt kit is another prebuilt kit, then you can tie the component kit to a work order. Kit component sourcing is initiated on the Kits page in Advanced Line Entry. You can source one or more components from the Multi-Comp Sourcing page. You can also source a component when you add a component to a kit. If you create a fabricated kit in Sales Order Entry, then you must source the components in KP Work Order Center Entry. Ties are only created if the quantity ordered is less than the quantity reserved. To create a tie for a component that has the full quantity reserved, add the kit to the sales order without sourcing the component. Then, in the Kit Details section for the component, change the reserved amount for component to less than the quantity needed before creating the tie. The tie is created for the quantity ordered less the quantity reserved. Note: You cannot delete a component that is tied to a source document from a sales order. Use these instructions to create a tie for one or more components: Create a stock order. In Advanced Line Entry, specify the BOD or nonstock kit in the Product field, and then specify the quantity. Click Kits. Select one or more components to tie to a sourcing document, and then click Multi-Comp Sourcing. Specify the product source. Complete the remaining fields for the selected product source.

If a component of the prebuilt kit is another prebuilt kit, then you can tie the component kit to a work order. Kit component sourcing is initiated on the Kits page in Advanced Line Entry. You can source one or more components from the Multi-Comp Sourcing page. You can also source a component when you add a component to a kit. If you create a fabricated kit in Sales Order Entry, then you must source the components in KP Work Order Center Entry. Ties are only created if the quantity ordered is less than the quantity reserved. To create a tie for a component that has the full quantity reserved, add the kit to the sales order without sourcing the component. Then, in the Kit Details section for the component, change the reserved amount for component to less than the quantity needed before creating the tie. The tie is created for the quantity ordered less the quantity reserved. Note: You cannot delete a component that is tied to a source document from a sales order. Use these instructions to create a tie for one or more components: Create a stock order. In Advanced Line Entry, specify the BOD or nonstock kit in the Product field, and then specify the quantity. Click Kits. Select one or more components to tie to a sourcing document, and then click Multi-Comp Sourcing. Specify the product source. Complete the remaining fields for the selected product source. When you are sourcing a single component, the ARP vendor or warehouse is displayed. When you are sourcing multiple components, the ARP vendor or warehouse is not displayed because the ARP for each component can be different. Click Submit, and then click the left arrow to return to Advanced Line Entry. Click Add to add the line to the order. . Finish the order.",

      "narr2": "S21. Confirm Pricing -  Selling products for highest price paid If a customer places an order for a product and has historically paid a higher price than the price that defaults in Sales Order Entry, you can set system options to force the higher price for that product and customer. This ensures that the customer is not offered the product at a price less than they are accustomed to paying, and you receive the highest margin on the sale. This may also encourage customers to agree to a contract price to receive a better price in the future. To implement the Highest Price Paid pricing search, you must set two options in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders: Months History and Exclude Level 2. These options define the number of months of sales history to search for the highest price, and whether to exclude Price Type Level 2 sales in the search. The Highest Price Paid search is not conducted if the original default price was determined using a contract price. A contract price is a Price Type level 1 (Customer/Product) PD Pricing Setup record. The contract price is not changed by the Highest Price Paid search. Additionally, if you use Price Type level 2 pricing records (Cust/Prod Price Type, Cust/Prod Line, Cust/Prod Cat, or Cust/Rebate Type), and the Exclude Level 2 option is selected, any prices that originally default on the sales order line using level 2 pricing records are not overridden by the highest price paid. If you use promotional pricing, you still have the option to choose between the promotional price and non-promotional price. The non-promotional price reflects the highest price, if it applies. If you do not have permission to select a promotional price (the Access Promo Price in OE option in SA Operator Setup-Entry Options is not selected), the Promo Price Default selection in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders determines the price to use: Lowest, Promo, or Regular. This automatic selection may result in the promo price instead of the highest price being selected. You can override contractual level pricing with multiple level price search. This pricing search can conflict with the Highest Price Paid search. We recommend you select one method or the other, not both. When a sales order line price is replaced with a higher price by this search, the order number, suffix, and line number are stored on the new order line. In addition, the Price Origin Code is set to Ã¢â‚¬Å“HÃ¢ . This code is displayed in Sales Order Inquiry and Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry. To prevent the highest price search in Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry, select Return/Ignore Highest Price. Run the Sales Order Master List Report to see the Highest Price Order and Line that affected the Highest Price calculation. This is printed under the Original System Line Data section.",

If the Use Previous Non-Stock Settings option is selected in SA Operator Setup, the default product category from SA Administrator Options-Products-Defaults is assigned to the line. If there is no default product category, the product category from the most recent, active nonstock receipt is assigned. If there are no active nonstock receipts in Product Adjust Non-stock/Direct Order Entry, the product category from the most recent, inactive receipt is assigned. If the product is available in the ordering warehouse, or is an active nonstock that is set up in Product Adjust Non-stock/Direct Order Entry, and the Allow Non Stock Qty Ship Override option is selected in SA Operator Setup, you can force ship the available quantity to fill this order. If the product is available in another warehouse, you are notified that nonstock surplus exists in another warehouse. You can then tie this order to a warehouse transfer. If you use the existing settings, and surplus stock or nonstock product is available in other warehouses, an additional notification about surplus availability is displayed. You can change the warehouse to obtain the item from the other warehouse. Specify a product description and a product category. The product description is included on orders, invoices, and pick tickets. To source the product from a vendor, specify the vendor and product line. If you entered a quote order and plan to copy it to a direct order, you must specify a vendor. Otherwise, specify a warehouse in the next step. If you do not specify a vendor or warehouse, the nonstock line on the quote order is not copied to the direct order. To source the product from another warehouse, specify the warehouse. Depending on the product, the Non-Stock Quantity Available and Stock Quantity Available for the warehouse is displayed on this page. Use the Product lookup to see the quantities that are available in other warehouses. If you entered a quote order and plan to copy it to a direct order, you must enter a warehouse. Otherwise, specify a vendor number in the previous step. If you do not enter a vendor or warehouse, the nonstock line on the quote order is not copied to the direct order. Optionally, select one of these values in the Item Type field: Review For Inventory Select this value if you expect frequent orders of the nonstock product and think it should be added to stocked inventory. An Event Manager trigger is created. It notifies someone in your organization to convert this item to stock and review it in future replenishment cycles. This value is available only if the Event Manager event is active. Create As OAN-NS Select this value to create the nonstock product as an order as needed-nonstock (OAN-NS) product. To make this value available, a valid value must be selected for Allow OAN-NS Stocking in OE for Catalog on your SA Operator Setup record. Create As Catalog Select this value to create a catalog product from this product. To make this value available, the Catalog Stocked option in SA Administrator Options-Products-Defaults-Sales Processing must be selected. If you selected Create As OAN-NS or Create As Catalog in the previous step, click Default Fields. Specify the unit, serial or lot control, and special price/costing values to include on the Product Catalog Setup or Product Setup record. Click Submit. Specify a cost and other pricing information. If you do not specify a cost, then the order cannot be invoice processed. If the product is associated with a Pricing and Discounting record, you can adjust the price level on the Pricing view. This applies to all price levels. Optionally, select these options: Back Order Select this option to automatically create a back order when the shipped quantity is less than the ordered quantity. If Allow Back Order is not selected on the customer record, this message is displayed when you exit the Non-Stock page: Non-Stock Product; No Back Order Scheduled; Adjusted if Exists. You must then clear the Back Order option in the Nonstock page or the Extended Fields section on the Order Entry Advanced Line Entry page. Create Purchase Order If you specified a vendor in a previous step, select this option to create a purchase order for the product. To make this value available, a valid value must be selected for PO/WT Ties on your SA Operator Setup record. You cannot create a sourcing purchase order for a vendor or a vendor ship from that does not allow purchase orders. Rush Select this option to expedite the product. You can specify a rush amount in the Extended Fields section. Copy Comments Select this option to copy comments from the sales order line to the source document. NCNR Select this option if the nonstock is non-cancellable, non-returnable product. Complete the remaining applicable fields, and then click Submit. Specify the quantity, and verify the unit and price. To tie the line a PO or WT, click Sourcing. Select the product source. Specify or make changes to the related product source information. Click Submit. Click Add to add the line to the order. If the source document was created, the number is displayed. If the line is tied to a purchase order or transfer, the number of the source document is displayed. Complete the order. If you add additional nonstock products to the order, the default settings for the previous nonstock product on the order are displayed. This feature is not available if No is selected for Use Previous Non-Stock Settings on your SA Operator Setup record.",
