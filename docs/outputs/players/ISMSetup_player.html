This allows the user to select and clear the field at each level to signify the service order is awaiting receipt of parts.\nAutomatic: The Awaiting Parts field on Incident, SRO, SRO Line, and SRO Operation is disabled. The system selects and clears the field based on whether or not there is an associated planned SRO material transaction associated to an outstanding purchase order or not. This option also enables the Awaiting Parts and Parts Received Actions functionality.\nAwaiting Parts Actions\nChange Working Status To\nChange Priority Code To\nUpdate To Be Scheduled Flag\nParts Received Actions\nChange Working Status To\nChange Priority Code To\nUpdate To Be Scheduled Flag\nEmail SRO Lead Partner\nEmail Incident Owner\nEmail Content\nSpecify this information on the Partner tab:\nPartner Prefix\nSpecify a default prefix to use for all new partner ID numbers. The system uses this value, along with the standard expand key logic, to automatically generate the next available partner number.\nAuto Approve Non-Warranty Reimbursement\nSelect this check box if all reimbursable material, labor, and miscellaneous transactions should created as approved. This lets you skip the Expense Approval form.\nAuto Approve Warranty Reimbursement\nSelect this check box to automatically approve expenses logged to a SRO that has a warranty claim SRO type.\nDefault Labor Rate and Default Labor Cost\nSpecify values that are used to calculate the default rate and cost for an SRO labor transaction. If a rate or cost is not determined from the SRO, customer or partner/work code combination, these fields determine whether the rate and cost are defaulted from the partner or from the work code.\nPartner Reimbursement Accounts\nSpecify the Voucher, Credit, and Other accounts where expenses for SRO material, labor and miscellaneous transactions are posted for any transaction that is reimbursed to the partner. The amount is held in these accounts until moved out by reimbursing the partner. The account that is used depends on the method by which the partner is set up to be reimbursed. These accounts are considered control accounts and are locked down accordingly.\nNumber of Hours Per Day\nSpecify the maximum number of hours per day a partner can be scheduled.\nSchedule Board Read Only\nSelect this check box if you want to make the schedule board on the Schedules form read-only.\nSpecify this information on the Amortization Control tab:\nTotal Periods\nSpecify the number of periods that the amortization amount is divided between. Each month end date designates the end of a period.\nJournal\nSelect the accounting journal to use for the amortization. Journals are defined on the Journals form.\nSelect Trans Date From\nSpecify whether amortizations occur at the start or the end of the period.\nAmortize Contracts\nSelect this field if contracts are included in the amortization process.\nAmortization Accounts\nSelect the appropriate accounts to use for prepaid expenses and deferred revenue.\nSpecify this information on the Unit tab:\nAuto Build Unit Configuration on Shipment\nIf you select this field, the complete unit configuration is created as the item is shipped.

This may add time to the shipping process if the bill of materials is several levels deep.\nAuto Build Unit Configuration on Receipt\nIf you select this field, the complete unit configuration is created as the item is received. During the posting of a PO receipt of a serial-tracked item, a new unit is automatically created (inventory status set to \"In Inventory\") and the purchase order information is associated with the unit. If the Auto Build Configuration on Receipt field is selected, the configuration is created. If a warranty that is based on the Receive Date is associated with the unit or any of its components, the start date of each warranty is set to the day the unit was received. The Auto Build process runs through the default configuration of serial-tracked items to be built. This may add time to the receiving process if the item configuration is several levels deep.\nSet Install Date on Shipment\nIf you select this check box, the system sets the Install Date on the unit and its components to the date the unit is shipped. If the unit is shipped and then installed by a field technician at a later time, do not select this check box.\nInitial Configuration Display\nSpecify the number of levels the unit configuration expands by default.\nConfiguration Update Method\nSpecify how the system updates the unit configuration when an SRO Material Transaction is updated:\nAuto Synch: The system tries to add and remove configuration components without user intervention.\nAuto Append: The system tracks any additions or removals in a separate branch of the configuration tree.\nPrompt: Prompt users to determine whether they want to manually adjust the configuration.\nNever: The unit configuration is not affected by posted material transactions.\nNote: For more information about this field and the following two fields, see Unit Configuration Automation Control.\nDefault Configuration Removal Reason\nSpecify a default reason that the system uses when a component is removed through the Auto Sync or Auto Append method. This value is also used as the default reason on the Unit Configurations form when the Remove Date is manually specified for a component.\nConfiguration Change History Branch\nIf your system uses the Auto Append method for unit configuration updates, the value you specify here is used to determine the name of the branch in the configuration that holds components that are added or removed when SRO material transactions are posted. We recommend that you change this value every year, to track components in a separate node each year.\nSpecify this information on the Other tab:\nUse Separate Consumer\nSelect this check box to maintain consumer records in the consumer database instead of the customer database. If you select this check box, incidents will always be billed to customers and you will not have the option to bill an incident to a consumer. This check box is useful if your business is directed at consumers who are not invoiced for parts and services and you would prefer to market to consumers separately from customers.\nDefault Customer\nSelect the customer number to use by default on the Consumers form each time a new consumer record is created.\nCommission Due on Payment\nSelect this check box to require a commission to be due when the invoice is fully paid. Or, when a customer makes a partial payment on the invoice, the a commission due payment is generated and prorated (although the invoice is not paid in full). Clear this check box to require a commission to be due when the order is invoiced.\nEnable Schedule Events\nSelect this check box to enable event triggers for appointments, service orders, and service order operations.\nA system administrator determines the actions that are triggered and sets them up on the Event Handlers form.\n\nSee the online help topics about application events and event triggers for more information about how to use event triggers.\n\nTo use Extended Mapping Configuration, on the Other tab, specify this information:\nMap Provider\nSelect Bing or Azure or Google as the map provider.\nMap API Key\nSpecify the API key for the map.

The map style and configuration settings are applied based on the Map ID that is stored in Google Cloud. This ID can be created for various platforms such as JavaScript, Android, iOS, and Web Services.\n\nNote: This field is displayed, only if the value in the Map Provider field is set to Google.\nAlternatively, to use Standard Mapping Configuration, on the Other tab, specify this information:\nMap URLs\nIf using Bing, the URLs for the map and directions are displayed. If using a different Web browser, specify the URLs to use by default for the map and directions.\nSet to Google\nClick this button to configure your Web browser to use the predefined links for Google for the map and directions.\nSet to Bing\nClick this button to configure your Web browser to use the predefined links for Bing for the map and directions.\nSee the Infor Service Management User and Administration Library (Cloud) and select Administrator > Map Administration > Map Configuration > Standard mapping configuration.\n\nSave the parameters.\nRelated topics\nSetting up the System for Incidents\nSetting Up the System for Service Request Orders (SROs)\nUsing an Incident to Create a Service Order\nAbout Incident Escalation\nAutomating Updates to Unit Configurations\nSetting Up the Map Functionality\n\nThe Management and your project team would like you to practice this and other processes so that the Go live is smooth or if your new to the company or are new to the role you can get proficient in the training environment \u000bAs one becomes more proficient in this system it behooves us to share that knowledge and help other so the Company can  achieve its destiny", "uap_url": "", "uap_label": "", "FAQ_Loc": "../faq", "FAQ_File": "PPS_ISMSetup_faq.html", "FAQ_Label": "ISM_Setup_FAQ's", "Quiz_Loc": "", "Quiz_File": "", "Quiz_Label": "", "meta": {"entity": "PALCO", "function": "Service", "subentity": "ISMSetup"}}, {"sop_id": "ISMSetup", "frame_code": "S999", "title": "S999.
